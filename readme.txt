7/9 changes:

I added a footer view. All controller functions need to start with a header and end with a footer. 

There's no need to end the Container div on the pages. It now ends on the Footer. 

The footer and the header are in a new view folder, template. I separated the Static and the Store views into Static and Store folders. 

There is a product page for the first product on the store page. The store page is complete for the time being. I haven't added the shopping cart yet, which is what I'll be doing tonight. 

We need to add a refund page and a privacy page. I noticed them at the bottom of the page. The links and routes are already made. The content is up there on the Zosseo webpage.
