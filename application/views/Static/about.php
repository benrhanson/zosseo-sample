		<p class="drillstops-text">Most guide manufacturers do an excellent job of determining ideal implant position with a cbct image and provide stents to the clinician for the implant placement. The one variable that remains unmanaged is the depth of the drill penetration. Laboratories recommend clinicians use single use drills and multiple stents with stops built in (added cost) or suggest using surgical guide inserts from the drill manufacturers with drills of varying width and length with built in stops (added cost). Using inexpensive, reusable drill stops in a guide with a matching tube diameter replaces all of these options with one simpler, and more economic.</p>
